# umount-test-opts

This repository contains files to perform equivalence testing of the `-O` option implementation for `umount(8)` shipped with [BusyBox](https://busybox.net/) and [util-linux](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/utils/util-linux/util-linux.git).

## Background

The `-O` option provided by `umount(8)` unmounts file systems by mount options.
This is implemented by checking the mount options of a file system against a provided pattern.
The function which performs this comparison is called [`mnt_match_options()`](https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/v2.37/libmount-docs/libmount-Options-string.html#mnt-match-options) in util-linux.
Vanilla BusyBox does not provide this feature but I have written a patch which [adds this feature to Busybox](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/busybox/2022-June/089769.html).
The corresponding function is called `fsopts_matches` in my patch.
This is an attempt to check if my BusyBox implementation of this feature is "correct".

## Setup

The setup provided here uses [symbolic execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_execution) with [KLEE](https://klee.github.io) to ensure that both implementations always return the same value for the same input strings via `assert(3)`:

    assert(mnt_match_options(options, pattern) == fsopts_matches(options, pattern));

This is a well-known idea which is already mentioned in the [original KLEE paper](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/osdi08/tech/full_papers/cadar/cadar.pdf) (Section 5.5).
For two 8 byte inputs KLEE finds 313153 execution paths for this assertion under the constraints mentioned below.
On all of these execution paths the assertion holds.

## Usage

This repository uses the KLEE [Docker](https://www.docker.io/) image, to use this image run:

    $ docker build -t klee-umount .
    $ docker run -it klee-umount

Within the container run the following commands:

    $ cd umount
    $ make sim

This will execute the code with KLEE.

## Limitations

* The equivalence checked is only performed for fixed-size strings of length `N`.
* The input is heavily constrained since the BusyBox implementation does, for example, not support disabling the "no" interpretation using a "+" prefix.
* Edge cases like ",,,," are excluded. See cd84f26e3a55d6b38897f21ab1eb49e3ffcce86e.
